# ðŸš€ Beating BM25 : Information Retrieval Challenge


## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This advanced information retrieval project tackles the challenge of surpassing the BM25 algorithm on the NFCorpus dataset. Leveraging a complex medical corpus, we aim to develop an innovative retrieval system that outperforms BM25, which remains a strong baseline in many scenarios.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

- Develop an original information retrieval system for NFCorpus
- Surpass BM25 performance using innovative techniques
- Implement and evaluate various pre-processing and vocabulary manipulation methods
- Explore the use of pre-trained or custom word2vec models
- Optimize for nDCG@5 metric
